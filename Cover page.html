			When thesy saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth
			has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and 
			of the Holy Spirit, and teacdhing them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'"
